MCL is an algorithm to estimate the position and orientation of a robot. Usually, the robot is given a map. Every time when a robot moves, it senses its environment and determines its location. In a perfect world, the robot’s movement can be easily predicted by math. For example, when starting and ending locations are given, the robot can calculate the distance and find out the direction. However, this is not the case in the real world. Some irregularities, such as bumps on the ground, dirt in the wheels, etc., can affect the robot’s movement, which can cause the robot to miss it’s destination. The robots use localization in order to combat that. Using localization, the robot can figure out its state, which is its position and its orientation. At t = 0, the robot’s algorithm starts with a uniform distribution of particles over the map, which means that the robot could be anywhere. As the robot moves, it rearranges the particles to predict its new position and orientation after it moves. For example, if a robot moved to the right, the map of the particles would also shift to the right, and if the robot rotates counter-clockwise 90 degrees, the map of the particles rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise. When the robot detects something, such as an obstacle, the actual sensed particles are compared to the predicted particles and are resampled. This process repeats. Each time, the robot improves its map location prediction. The areas on the map with a higher concentration of dots mean the robot thinks it’s more likely to be there. As time passes on, the dots become more and more concentrated at one region, so the robot knows where it is with a lot of certainty. Note that MCL only works if the environment does not change over time. This is because the algorithm assumes the Markov property, which states that the current state’s probability distribution depends only on its previous state.
